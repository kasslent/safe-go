      <p>If the attacker is on top of you (and you are on your back), grab their face and dig your fingers into their eye sockets. Keep the other hand around their neck as you lift your hips to roll them over. When they’re on their back, hit their nose or rip their ear off. While they’re distracted with the pain, run.
      
      <h4> *Beware of the following: (how to spot a potential attacker)</h4>
      
      Have you ever felt unsafe walking home or to any particular destination? We, the creators of SafeGo, have decided that it’s time for everyone to start feeling safe. In order to do that, you first have to be able to detect if you are in possible danger or not.  To find out if the stranger you keep seeing could be a threat to you, keep in mind a few things: 
      Verbal cues
      Body language
      Great deal of eye contact
      When someone follows you and shows up wherever you are
      When they’re driving by / hanging out by your school, work or house
      When they’re creating / manipulating situations in order to come in contact with you
        You should never confront a potential attacker alone </p>
